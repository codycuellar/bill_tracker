# bill_tracker
A simple bill notification system.

This program is a very preliminary hacked together version just to get up and
running for my personal use. In order to use it, some tweaking on the user's end
is needed, as well as a properly formatted CSV, or JSON file. Eventually, my goal
is to have it a properly installably package that can be deployed and set up to
run a web interface for interacting with the data to run on a virtual server such
as AWS (how I currently have it configured).
